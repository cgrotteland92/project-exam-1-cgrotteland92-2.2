        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          At NextAI, we believe that AI has the power to change lives, and we’re
          here to make it accessible to businesses of all sizes. Our journey
          began with a shared vision among three former university classmates
          who came together at a tech conference in early 2023. With backgrounds
          in computer science, data ethics, and business strategy, they were
          united by a common mission: to build AI tools that solve real-world
          challenges while upholding the highest ethical standards. What started
          as an idea quickly grew into a thriving team. By the end of our first
          year, we’d assembled a diverse group of 30 talented individuals who
          shared our passion for creating AI solutions that make a meaningful
          impact. From engineers and data scientists to UX designers and
          customer success specialists, each team member brings unique skills
          and perspectives to our shared mission.

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is simple yet ambitious: To empower businesses with
          ethical, user-friendly AI technology that enhances productivity,
          solves real problems, and fosters growth. We’re focused on creating
          tools that adapt to the needs of small and medium-sized businesses,
          allowing them to harness the power of AI without the complexity or
          high costs. Through our products, we strive to bridge the gap between
          cutting-edge technology and practical applications, helping businesses
          improve customer interactions, streamline workflows, and make better
          decisions.
